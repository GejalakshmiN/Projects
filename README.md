# Projects
Welcome to my project portfolio! This repository serves as a central hub to explore the web applications and websites I’ve built using technologies like FastAPI, MySQL, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Each project highlights a specific skill set—from backend logic and database integration to frontend design and responsiveness.
1. Online Examination and Grading Management System
A full-stack web application designed to conduct and evaluate subject-wise multiple-choice questions (MCQ) exams. Built with FastAPI for the backend and MySQL for data persistence, it allows secure student registration and login, presents dynamic quizzes based on selected subjects, and automatically calculates marks and grades upon submission. The grades are stored in the database for future reference, and the dashboard displays personalized information including performance history. The system ensures user data integrity and supports a structured grading workflow.

2. Personal Portfolio Website
A clean and responsive personal website developed using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, aimed at showcasing my projects, technical skills, educational background, and contact details. The site features smooth navigation, an elegant layout, and interactive elements that provide an engaging user experience. It reflects my web development capabilities and serves as a digital résumé to recruiters or collaborators.

3. Restaurant Website
A visually appealing and responsive restaurant website designed using HTML and CSS. The site includes a homepage, menu section, about page, and contact details, giving visitors a clear idea of the restaurant’s offerings and ambiance. Designed with mobile-first principles, the layout adjusts smoothly across different devices. The site can be expanded in the future to include functionalities like online ordering or table reservations.
